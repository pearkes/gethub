## Reporting a Bug

If you don't mind running the problem command (if applicable) in debug
mode and dumping the output in your GitHub issue, it'd be very helpful.

    gethub --debug [<command>]

## Development Environment

To add a feature, fix a bug, or to run a development build of `gethub`
on your machine, you'll need to have [go](http://golang.org/) installed.

You can then build a binary:

    $ go build

And run it:

    $ ./gethub

To install the development binary on your system:

    $ go install

Or run the tests:

    $ go test github.com/pearkes/gethub/steps -v

If you need help with your environment, feel free to open an issue.
